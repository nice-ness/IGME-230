Musical Memory
=======
## Osu except memorization is key! 

## Genre 
Rhythm, Memory, Puzzle, Music and Reaction 
## Platform
Desktop, and possibly a mobile version

## Story
The main premise of the game is to react as fast as possible to the give track.  
Mood is fast, exciting, and focused. The game is mostly abstract so not a strong narrative or theme,   
but they will progress simply by being able to follow the rhythm and react.  

## Esthetics
* Graphics style- abstract
* Sound – 8 bit or techno. Would like a variety of music for it. 
* Most sound would be focused on the music, a reaction sound for when ever you hit the correct tile. 

## Gameplay: 
* Mechanics – It is mainly a Rhythm reaction game. There will be a score based on how fast you react to the nodes glowing. 
* Control – Will mainly be a mouse based game, you could use the keyboard keys instead of pressing the mouse. Could also use arrow or WASD to move the pointer but I think its best as a mouse option.
* Teaching the game/Player Learning – A short tutorial rundown of the controls and the basic gameloop. Player learning would probably be how they like the react to the nodes or if they want to memorize the whole map. It will be juggling these skills to progress and get better at the game.
